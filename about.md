The Turing is pleased to host the first virtual student research showcase.
This initiative aims to highlight the work being carried out by students who have been funded by the Institute through one of its Doctoral or Enrichment schemes. This is an excellent opportunity for you to find out more about the
on-going work at the Turing and forge new collaborations.

We're running two thematic poster sessions on the following dates:

- 16-17 September 2020

- 23-24 September 2020

Posters become available for download on the first day and Q&A sessions are led by the authors on the second day. This allows you to come prepared with questions. You can find each day's schedule above, in the navigation bar.

Please support the students by attending at least 3 Q&A sessions, though you are not required to stay for the entire hour.

If you have any queries please email us at [student-posters@turing.ac.uk](mailto:student-posters@turing.ac.uk).
