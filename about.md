The Turing is pleased to host the first virtual research showcase for the student community. This is an excellent opportunity for you to find out more about the research our Doctoral, Enrichment and Visiting students carry out during their time at the Turing. The event is open to researchers from university partners and beyond, the internal Turing community as well as any members of the public.

## How does it work

The student posters will be compiled according to the application domains of each data-driven research piece. The poster presentations will be composed of static resources (access to the posters, video recordings and written abstracts), as well as highly interactive Q&A Zoom sessions hosted by each poster author. Live showcases will take place 10 am - 5 pm with 1-hour live presentation slots for each poster, throughout the following dates:

- 17 September 2020

- 24 September 2020

You are not required to attend the entire days, but please support the students by attending at least 3 Q&A sessions (where you don't have to stay for the entire hour).

If you have any questions, please email us at student-posters@turing.ac.uk
