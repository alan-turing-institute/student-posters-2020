Notes:

- Put your poster title in the subject line of the email.
- If submitting multiple entries, please send separate emails for each entry.
- If your video file is larger than the file size limit on outlook (20 MB)
save it to OneDrive and send us a link to it instead.

## Posters

- You have to submit a poster in order to participate in the showcase as an
author.
- Provide your poster in a single-page pdf file.
- We do not require specific page dimensions, but make sure font sizes and figures are scaled appropriately.
- Posters become available for public view on the first day of each showcase
(16th and 23rd of September respectively) and stay open after.
- How you structure your poster is up to you, but you should try to strike
the right balance between too little and too much text. The same principle
applies to figures. Since this is a virtual event, viewers can navigate your
poster freely, zooming in on particular sections as they require more detail.
So you can choose to follow a more traditional structure, resembling an
academic paper, or a less dense structure that would be more adequate for
a public display (in-person). Either way, don't be afraid to get creative!


## Q&A sessions

- Your participation in Q&A sessions is optional.
- Zoom Q&A sessions take place in hourly time slots.
- You have 6 distinct time slots to choose from.
- Up to two Q&A sessions may run simultaneously.
- Q&A sessions run on the **second day** of each showcase. This allows people
to view your poster beforehand and attend the Q&A with prepared questions,
resulting in a more stimulating discussion.
- You may choose to use existing presentation slides, schematics and other
auxiliary material during the Q&A.

## Video

- It is optional to record a video presenting your poster.
- You can choose to do a video in one or both of these formats:
	- Short: 1 minute video where you provide some highlights similar to a lightning talk. Think of this as an opportunity for the participants to skim through your poster when deciding which ones interest them the most.
	- Long: 10 minute video where you provide an in-depth description and discussion of your work, as you would do in a talk. You may use slides and other support material.
- If you are not comfortable with recording yourself, you can just record audio
and even caption your video if you are not comfortable recording your voice
either.
- Video software freely available on MacOS:
	- [Photo Booth](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/photo-booth/pbhlp3714a9d/mac), to record via the webcam.
	- The keyboard shortcut [Shift-Command-5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721), to record your screen.
	- [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) to edit and assemble your video.
