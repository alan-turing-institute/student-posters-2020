As an author, you will be asked to provide the following:

1. A **poster** in pdf format.
3. A 1 hour slot where you are available to answer questions from the
"audience" on **Zoom**.
2. A **video** presenting your poster (optional).

See below for further guidelines and advice on each of these categories.

## Posters

- You have to submit a poster in order to participate in the showcase as an
author.
- Provide your poster in a single-page pdf file.
- We do not require specific page dimensions, but make sure font sizes and figures are scaled appropriately.
- Posters are made available to the general public on the first day of each showcase (16th and 23rd of September respectively) and remain open thereafter.
- You decide how your poster is structured, but try to strike the right balance
between too little and too much text. The same principle applies to figures.
Since this is a virtual event, viewers can navigate your poster freely, zooming
in on particular sections as required. So you can choose to follow a more
traditional structure, resembling an academic paper, or a less dense structure
that would be more adequate for a public display (in-person). Either way, we
encourage you to be creative!


## Q&A sessions

- Your participation in the Q&A sessions is compulsory.
- These are organised in hourly time slots and you are assigned 1 of 6 distinct
slots, with up to two Q&A sessions running simultaneously.
- Q&A sessions take place on the **second day** of each showcase. This allows
people to view your poster beforehand and attend the Q&A with questions
prepared.
- You may use existing presentation slides, schematics and other auxiliary
material during the Q&A.

## Video

- It is optional to record a video presenting your poster.
- You can choose to do a video in one or both of the following formats:
	- **Short**: 1 minute video where you provide project highlights, similarly
	to a lightning talk. Think of this as an opportunity for the participants to
	skim through your poster when deciding which ones interest them the most.
	- **Long**: 5 to 10 minute video with an in-depth description and discussion
	of your work, as you would do in a talk. You may use slides and other
	supporting material.
- If you are not comfortable with recording video or audio, you can instead record your screen and use captions.
- Useful software on MacOS:
	- [Photo Booth](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/photo-booth/pbhlp3714a9d/mac), to record via the webcam.
	- The keyboard shortcut [Shift-Command-5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721), to record your screen.
	- [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) to edit and assemble your video.
