  THE term “connectomics” refers to utilizing big data and computing approaches to assemble and analyze connections in the human brain. A major theoretical force that motivates connectomics stems from the idea that networks are fundamental to understanding the brain’s structural and functional organization. Neurosurgery is a clinical discipline based on the premise of physically manipulating the brain's network space for therepeutic benefit. However, to date, the field of connectomicis has hardly been employed to advance clinical neurosurgery. In this study, we harness big data and multi-modal brain imaging from healthy subjects (n=650) and also n=17 neurosurgical patients repeatedly sampled over time to understand the effects of cancer, surgery, and rehabilitation on brain networks and cognition.
