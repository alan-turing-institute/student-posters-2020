  Tailored Bayes: a risk modelling framework under unequal classification costs
abstract: |
  Risk prediction models are a crucial tool in healthcare. They are often constructed, however, using methodology which assumes the costs of different misclassifications are equal. In many healthcare applications this assumption is not true. The differences between misclassification costs can be quite large. For instance, in a diagnosis setting, the cost of misdiagnosing a person with a life-threatening disease as healthy may be larger than the cost of misdiagnosing a healthy person as a patient. In this work, we present Tailored Bayes (TB), a novel Bayesian inference framework which "tailors" model fitting to optimise predictive performance with respect to unbalanced misclassification costs.We use simulation studies to showcase when TB is expected to outperform standard Bayesian methods. We then apply TB to two breast cancer real-world applications, a prognostication and tumour classification task, and further demonstrate the improvement in predictive performance over standard methods.
