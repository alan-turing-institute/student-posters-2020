  An agent-based model of jaywalking: Representing contested street space in models of pedestrian movement
abstract: |
  Modelling how pedestrians adapt their road crossing behaviour to their local environment can help us consider how changes to street environments, such as the introduction of autonomous vehicles or creation of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, change how street space is used. We present a framework for modelling a pedestrianâ€™s gradual deliberation and choice between discrete road crossing options. We implement this model within a spatial agent-based model and generate road crossing trajectories that are dependent on pedestrian characteristics and adaptive to local traffic and infrastructure, reproducing some characteristic features of pedestrian behaviour.
