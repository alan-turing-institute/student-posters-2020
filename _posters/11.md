  An agent-based model of jaywalking: Representing contested street space in models of pedestrian movement
abstract: |
  In this paper, we present an agent-based model of pedestrian urban movement in which pedestrian agents update their perceptions of the local environment as they move and use this information to inform their route and, in particular, where to cross the road. The objective of this work is to develop a model of pedestrian spatial cognition which reproduces the heterogeneous and spatially varying road crossing behaviour that has been observed in urban areas.
